# Giphy Project

## Summary & Goal

The goal of the Giphy project was to make a jQuery .ajax() call to the Giphy API. From here, it was up to use what search queries should be used and what information should be displayed to the user. Needless to say, there was some fun to be had on this one.

This was a project for the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.
